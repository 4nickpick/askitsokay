## It's Okay to Ask
***A response to https://dontasktoask.com/ for senior developers***

Every now and then, in online spaces packed with expert developers, a new developer will ask a question along the lines of:

```Junior7: Any Java experts around?```

Experts, exhausted from sitting at a desk all day doing God's work on a Qwerty keyboard, reply with hurtful memes, downvotes, and general derision under the guise of being helpful. 

This is bad form, for several reasons. What the new developer is actually asking here is,

```Junior7: Any Java experts around who are willing to work through a problem with me? I have no idea what I'm doing. There's so much information on the internet that I get overloaded, and would really appreciate someone's help to point me in the right direction.```

Many people don't know how to ask the question they need to ask. They may need to provide additional context. They are timid and concerned that developers will flame them for being stupid. 

This is a justified fear, because that's exactly what happens often enough. 

By mocking them, you're dissuading them from pursuing a career in technology as a developer. And hurting the industry as a whole. 

Instead, it's okay to ask a question back: 

```GentleExpert92: I know Java. What's your question?```

They'll then tell you the details you'd wished they'd provided upfront. No mockery required. Time saved. Humanity restored. 

You might think this junior is lazy - too lazy to ask a detailed question about topics they know next-to-nothing about (possibly in a natural language they are still learning). 

Doesn't the fact that they are trying to learn to code prove otherwise? 

Isn't it possible that they aren't brainless soul-sucking leeches who went out of their way to inconvenience you? 

If you see a harmless question from a new dev asking for help, and you find it burdensome that they didn't provide more details - you can just walk away. 

Anything other than asking follow-up questions could be seen as..

```JavaMaster420: I know everything. Including HOW you should ask questions. You've done literally everything wrong. Down to the words you've used to ask for help. You should be embarrased, go read a book. Beep, boop.```

By asking a simple follow-up question, you show the new developer it's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to ask questions, even if you don't know how to ask the question. 

And as engineers and scientists, it should always be okay to ask questions. Even if we don't know how to ask the question, yet. 

So, to summarize, it's okay to ask follow-up questions. If you're busy, it's okay to move on. 

Let's encourage new developers, we need them. Default to kindness.
